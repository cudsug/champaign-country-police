# Urbana Police Incidents

## Organization Name
- Urbana Police Department
 
## Local Sponsor
Sanford Hess, IT Director of Urbana, responsible for the Area-wide Records Management Systems (ARMS) 

## Overview
These three police agencies in Champaign County share a common Records  Management System (called “ARMS”) that contains information on police activity.  Due to their use of a common system, the data has a consistent format - although some code values are unique to each jurisdiction for local ordinances.

## Problem Statement
Police records are commonly requested sets of data for analysis of both crime and police interactions with the public.  Police data can be useful for analysis on its own, or combined with other data about the population to gain insights.  For example, the United States Census Bureau has datasets by County and some by “Census block” https://www.census.gov/topics/population/data.html.  These police agencies are looking for creative uses of the data that could lead them into further analysis using more granular datasets.

## Evaluation criteria
- Insights on trends visible in existing data.
- Creative use of other datasets in combination with the data.
- Creatives ideas for further analysis that could be performed by the police agencies themselves.

## Data Details
| File Name | Description | Link |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Crisis Intervention Team Forms | The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trains police officers on interacting with people in crisis. Sometimes these interactions occur during other police activity, but many times they are during contact that does not result in a police report. The "CIT Form" collects information about the person in crisis, and is used to track contact with individuals over time - so that during later interactions with the same person the officers are aware of the person's crisis history. The rows of this dataset are the information collected from those interactions. The dataset is anonymized in two ways: the report numbers and the person identifiers are both replaced with simple numbers. IMPORTANT: the report numbers are unique, but the person numbers repeat if one person had multiple interactions. | https://data.urbanaillinois.us/Police/Crisis-Intervention-Team-Actions/89vb-nvfz |
